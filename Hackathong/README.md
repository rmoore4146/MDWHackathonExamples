Notes:

- Requires Maven 3.0.3 - M2 does not work.
- Requires ANDROID_HOME env variable set (and $ANDROID_HOME/tools & $ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools on the $PATH as well)
- If you run this out of an IDE - you must set you ANDROID_HOME from an etc/launchd.conf configuration instead of a bashrc or .bash_profile config. Those Env variables are not available to the IDE instances.
